# NAME
hash-cmp - check hash values easily

# SYNOPSIS
**hash-cmp** [*OPTION...*] input\_file expected\_hash

# DESCRIPTION
**hash-cmp** will help calculate and compare hash values quickly and easily.
This tool automatically calculates the hash value of a file, compares it with the expected value and highlights the differences in color.

Additionally, the tool supports multiple different hash functions.
It will detect which hash method was used to create the expected hash value and decide on the correct value to calculate autonomously.
Supported hash functions are:\
		- Sha224\
		- Sha256\
		- Sha384\
		- Sha512

# OPTIONS
**-h**

**-q**
: quiet mode, only print the hash values without any additional information

# EXIT CODES
**0**
: the calculated hash matches the expected hash

**255**
: the calculated hash does NOT match the expected hash

# EXAMPLES
**hash-cmp -h**
